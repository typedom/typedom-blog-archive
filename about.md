##About Type Dom
<i>Type Dom</i> is my little corner of the internet. It originally started as a blog that I've been writing in one iteration after another since 2007. Nowadays, it serves as a way to put down my thoughts about all the 
little big things in life.

<i>Type Dom</i> runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is based off of the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.
