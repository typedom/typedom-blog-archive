I love towers and their observation decks. When I travel, I feel like I haven't really seen or understood a city until I've walked through its streets and seen those same streets from 
some really high vantage point. So when I went to Taipei recently, after making it into the city and checking into the hotel, I made my way straight to the tallest building I could see: 
Taipei 101.



Towers are often monuments to their city; often controversial in their construction, but always in celebration of the city itself. Taipei 101 is no exception to this. Once the tallest 
building in the world, it's a technological marvel that now dominates the Taipei skyline. It's 101 floors are meant to represent an ideal of breaking past barriers, being one above one 
hundred. The tower was built to withstand both typhoons and earthquakes and has the world's largest tuned mass damper to stabilise the tower, something that they're so proud of they 
turned it into the tower's mascot.

Heading up Taipei 101 involved a bit of wandering around the shopping mall at the base, past the high end brands like Louis Vutton, up multiple escalators and then waiting in line with 
the masses of Chinese tour groups before being crammed into what is a very impressive elevator. The elevator heading to the top of Taipei 101 is the fastest elevator in the world, 
travelling at around 60 km/h, though it's hard to really appreciate it given how you're only inside it for about 40 seconds.

When I stepped out the elevator, it seemed like I was stepping into a different world. The tinted windows and the steady light streaming in through them painted everything with an 
emerald wash making the whole floor seem just a little surreal. People became long shadows against the backdrop of the city, just shapes to avoid while jostling for position at the 
windows. But looking out at the city from about 100 floors up cuts through the jet lag and makes the trip start to feel real. I'm not in my city anymore, the view is different.

Being up on an observation deck is always an exciting time for me. Whether it's being blasted by winter winds on top of the Empire State Building or staring through rain clouds in Mori 
Tower, there's just something magical about being so high up. There's that tinge of fear from being untethered to the ground, but also an excitement about the city. I can feel the pulse 
of the city from its streets, see the way its wrapped itself around mountains and rivers. It puts into context all the places I've been and gives me a glimpse of all the places I still 
want to visit. With the city sprawled out beneath me, its view invading every window from every angle, it's as if I'm having an intimate conversation with the city itself. Just me and 
a strange new city.
