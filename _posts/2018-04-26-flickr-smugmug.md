The other day it was announced that [Flickr had been acquired by SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com/together/). While I still link my Flickr account on my blog and in some other places, it isn't really a website I use that 
often now and, judging by what I read online, I'm not the only one.

I think that every aspiring or hobbyist photographer in the last decade or so has gone through a Flickr phase. Unlike the other social media services, Flickr was really just about 
photography rather than a lifestyle/micro-blogging platform and it was an easy way to upload and host images online for free. But the real value of Flickr was its communities. Groups 
could be formed around pretty much any topic, whether it be based on what type of camera you used, your geographic location or what type of photography you did. This allowed to Flickr 
to really cater to everything a casual photography might need, from being a technical support forum to helping foster a genre of photography, like the infamous [Hardcore Street 
Photography](https://www.flickr.com/groups/onthestreet/) group.

But eventually I moved on, and so it seems mostly everyone else did. Maybe it was the Flickr redesign that made Groups that much harder to visit or the acquisition by Yahoo (who have a 
track record of running things into the ground). On a photo level, I don't like how Flickr (and the internet in general) tends to focus on single photographs rather than a series. I'm 
more interested in things you can do with a body of work (which is why I love photobooks), but the internet doesn't seem to have that kind of patience. 

Mostly though, I think just I moved on from the way people like to talk about photography on the internet. There's a lot of tribalism, particularly over camera brands (Nikon vs Canon, 
or nowadays, Sony vs Canon) and rules over what photography is and isn't (like the Internet Street Photography scene), and it all just gets tiring after awhile. Photography happens in 
the world, not online.

Flickr being acquired by SmugMug is interesting and while I haven't used SmugMug, I have a [friend who is](bubbys.smugmug.com) and I've seen it used around the internet as well. I hope 
they do make changes to a site that has very much stagnated over the years, but it will take some bold changes for me to get back on board.
