I'm not really sure what to think of TWICE lately. They've come to dominate the Kpop market (or at least the girl group side of it), and its hard not to see why. They've got a string of 
infectiously addictive songs backed by easy to learn dance moves and have so much personality that they become internet memes just by being themselves.

But at the same time, I don't think they've changed much over the last few years. What is Love? is one of their better songs of late (though I'm not a fan of the shout/chanting in the 
song), but it still feels like its too similar to their other songs like Knock Knock or Heartbreaker. It's too safe a song, especially coming from JYP who has produced some of the most 
addictively quriky songs of recent years like TWICE's Signal or I.O.I's Very Very Very. I wonder if the mixed reception to Signal made JYP err on the side of caution and make a more 
conservative song.

On the otherhand, the MV for What Is Love? is their best since TT. The MV sees the girls playing various roles in movies like the Princess Diaries, La La Land, oddly enough alongside 
more adult movies like Pulp Fiction and Leon: The Professional (the latter two being hit with the Kpop girl group filter to make them sparkly clean and innocent). This works well by 
playing off of the girls' personalities, like Jeongyeon's tomboyish nature, or contrasting Mina's stoic appearance with Dahyun's inherent goofiness, with the end result being a fun and 
insanely fanservicey video clip. But even within that, we see a lot of the same things that TWICE has shown us in other MVs, like Sana's unrequited affection for Jeongyeon, and it makes 
me wonder if this group will evolve into new thing or stay in the same characters and songs that they've always had.

I think TWICE is the most "modern" of kpop groups, having defined the things that a modern kpop girl group does (from launching the idol survival show craze to having their lives almost 
constantly filmed through reality shows and VLive streams), but I wonder if the formula that they created has an expiry date on it. Other groups have gone through different phases, such 
as Red Velvet's [Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyiIGEHQP8o) and [Velvet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE) sides or Oh My Girl's [fast-paced upbeat songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cjZFjWBZI0) vs their [slower, ethereal songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk), that keep things interesting. And while changing things up does come with 
risk, I would think that TWICE has the popularity to carry them through anything, so why not take a gamble on something? I guess I just want something more from TWICE.
